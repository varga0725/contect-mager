- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions guide

## üìä Testing Metrics and Coverage

### Coverage Targets
- **Lines:** 70%+ (adjusted from 80% due to existing codebase)
- **Functions:** 70%+
- **Branches:** 70%+
- **Statements:** 70%+

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests:** 200+ tests covering individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests:** 20+ tests covering complete workflows
3. **E2E Tests:** 15+ tests covering user journeys
4. **Accessibility Tests:** 10+ tests ensuring WCAG compliance
5. **Performance Tests:** 15+ tests monitoring system performance

## üöÄ Running the Test Suite

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Backend tests only
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests only  
cd frontend && npm run test:run

# E2E tests only
npm run test:e2e

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **Automated:** Tests run on every push and PR
- **Multi-environment:** Tests across different Node.js versions
- **Parallel:** Tests run in parallel for faster feedback
- **Reporting:** Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov

## üîç Test Quality Assurance

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Isolation:** Each test is independent and can run in any order
